### [Destination Linux](https://destinationlinux.org/)
A quartet of experienced linux users who provide weekly insight into the world of linux and discuss how things like community and advertising can be leveraged to advance the use of linux in business and private usage. They have a [mumble group](https://destinationlinux.network/mumble/) as well but I don't know how active it is since they do their live recordings for Patreons using Zoom.
