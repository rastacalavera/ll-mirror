### Self-hosted Image Sharing with Cheverto
This week I found myself browsing the LSIO images just looking for something new. I installed [freshrss](), [duplicati](), [jellyfin]() and [chevereto](). I talked about wallabag [last episode]() and don't think I mentioned that I now use freshrss as a catcher and server to my iphone rss app [NetNewsWire](). This combination has been great and I've found a few pages where wallabag doesn't scrape the whole site. Eventually, I plan on reporting those and seeing how that process works with the project.

Duplicati was pretty straight forward and I'll do a deep dive on that next week possibly. Jellyfin was also easy and well documented. Chevereto on the other hand, did not look or operate as expected when using other LSIO documentation.

### What is Chevereto?
[Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) is similar to [imgur](https://imgur.com/) and allows a user to upload a picture to a public or private gallery. Once the image is uploaded, it can be shared to other users or social media sites using a custom share link with your domain. Since it is self-hosted, you can control every aspect of the software and your images remain **YOUR** images. You can have your gallery be public or private and you can add and moderate users. It's pretty cool and can be made even cooler if you understand how to use their [API](https://v3-docs.chevereto.com/api/#api-key). I am currently trying to get it to work with Apple Shortcuts so that I can quickly send images to a private gallery.

### Chevereto Documentation
The project does have it's own [documentation](https://v3-docs.chevereto.com/setup/system/requirements.html#%F0%9F%93%8C-requirements) and it was pointed out to me by LSIO team member Spad that only MYSQL and Maria DB can be used which is in the project's documentation. LSIO's compose file did not have any DB associated with it. So when I went through the steps of bringing the container up and navigating to the landing page, which walks the user through the install and couldn't get past the initial page due to not having a database association.
```

version: "2.1"
services:
  chevereto:
    image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/chevereto
    container_name: chevereto
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=<TZ>
    volumes:
      - <path to config on host>:/config
      - <path to data on host>:/data
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    restart: unless-stopped
```
    
User Spad helped me to troubleshoot this and my refined compose file included a database and also explained how to make the containers go up and down together when using the bash aliases recommended by LSIO.

So my bash_alias now looks like this:  
```
alias dcup='docker-compose -f  ~/docker-compose.yml up -d --remove-orphans --always-recreate-deps'
```
I included the `--remove-orphans` because I typically start out with the LSIO naming scheme and once everything works, I change the names to my ideal phrasing. The `--always-recreate-deps` is what Spad told me about to bring up/down dependent containers. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to gracefully bring down dependent containers so as of now, when using `dcdown` both services need to be named, ie. `dcdown chevereto chev_dv`.

So my working compose file then follows this format:
```

version: "2.1"
services:
  chevereto:
    image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/chevereto
    container_name: chevereto
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=<TZ>
    volumes:
      - /opt/appdata/chevereto/config:/config
      - /opt/appdata/chevereto/data:/data
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - chev_db
  chev_db:
    image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/mariadb
    container_name: chev_db
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<chevrootpasswd>
      - TZ=<TZ>
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=chev
      - MYSQL_USER=chevuser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<chevrpasswd>
    volumes:
      - /opt/appdata/chevereto/db/data:/config
    restart: unless-stopped

```
So now that I got something working, I figured it was time to try to update LSIO documentation.

### Service Documentation is a Moving Target (at least for me)
At first, I just went to the Chevereto LSIO [page](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-chevereto) and edited the readme file. After I made my edits, I submitted a [Draft Pull Request](https://github.com/rastacalavera/docker-chevereto/pull/1) and then posted in the discord to let team members know. I was then directed to [additional documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-bookstack/blob/master/readme-vars.yml) that takes an indirect approach to editing the main readme file. I guess they are automatically updated with every pull request which is something I was unaware of initially. So I checked out that file and was taken aback at how jarring it was to make sense of what was going on. User Spad sent me a [bookstack example](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-bookstack/blob/master/readme-vars.yml) that was more detailed and allowed me to get a better grasp and what to edit and what needed to be included.

Because this is a template that autofills the details in the main readme, I did not have an easy or obvious way of previewing my work. Again, I went to the discord for clarification and was provided with [additional documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder#running-against-local-project). What I had expected to be a easy and helpful commit had now turned into a more detailed project that I was not expecting to take on.

### Supportive Discord and Perseverance
Given the extra steps required to follow the LSIO workflow, I was unsure as to whether or not I should proceed and if they team wanted to continue fielding my questions. One thing that I've learned while contributing to projects is that the dev team's time is very valuable. They may respond to you in short language and it's not a slight but just the best and most succinct way of offering aid. It's best to try not to take things personally and keeping a positive, polite attitude will benefit you in the long run. After asking several clarifying questions, I was able to successfully clone their jenkins workflow and the Chevereto project from git hub, change the `readme-vars.yml` and run the build process and push the results back to my github repo. From there, I made a PR and am currently waiting to see if it will be merged.
