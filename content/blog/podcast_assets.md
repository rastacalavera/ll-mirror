### Getting Involved
I would love people to submit work to the project or ask someone to attempt a project and report back on their process. 

In order to do this, there has to be a rigid methodology so that a user knows how to ask and what to present. I've come up with a few ideas that still need some testing but I think it is a good place to start.

### Asking For and Providing Help
* A [template](/files/Request_Template.odt) should be followed before a user asks for dedicated assistance.
* Contributors should clearly understand the goals and deliverable.

> I listen to shows and lurk in forums, telegram, etc. but my schedule doesn’t really line up with interacting with the community much.

>I’ve experienced the generosity from members in the community in terms of troubleshoot issues and recently thought, “WHY DIDN’T I DOCUMENT ANYTHING?!?!”. I want to solve personal technology problems AND help the community at the same time so this is where this crazy idea came from.
>
>What if there was an “open channel” that people could submit to and document/share their projects? Instead of scrolling through Google and forum posts to find solutions to problems, what if there was an audio file with accompanying concise documentation that provided answers and solutions to your problem! This is my idea of an open podcast.
>
>A request is made following an agreed upon template. If someone from the community chooses to pick up the request, it is marked as “pending”. By agreeing to pick up a request, both parties are committing to solving the problem and publishing the results in a format that benefits the community at large.
>
>The end result is a guaranteed submission to an audio stream (podcast) where a host sums up what the issue was and how it was solved and where additional resources can be accessed.
>
>I’m I crazy or is this a cool idea? I don’t know the best way to share documents other than google, so I made a quick post on my blog and added downloads in otd and pdf formats of the template and an example I created.
>
> To be clear, I don’t want this to benefit me as an individual. The thought is that individuals in the community benefit, we have a concise way to share that with everyone!
