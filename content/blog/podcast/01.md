# Beer #1, Install went fine
Installing the distro was no problem. Booted fine, updated fine, no worries.

Started to look at the [audio handbook](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/AudioHandbook/GettingStarted#Connecting_a_Sound_Card_With_JACK_and_Patchage) before getting side tracked with beer #2 and package installation. I do think I found a disconnect between the written documentation and the language (Connection vs Graph) in the most recent version of the software though.

# Beer #2, Software Installation
So, things I need beside the base installation packages:
* Hugo
    * Hugo installed fine. I just did the extended version deb file from their GitHub releases page.
* VScode
    * I did check the software center and the only option was a snap (HARD PASS). So I **GOOGLED** and got a deb file from their homepage. Installed fine. Now I had to get my ssh creds off my smb share so that I can connect to my Gitlab/hub stuff.
* Connections to my smb shares
    * Dolphin **REFUSES** to connect to my synology NAS shares . . . not by hostname or IP. I have no idea what is wrong with that. Ended up going to the web UI and downloading my stuff that way. When I tried to clone my repo with ssh, it said my permissions were all messed up. Had to `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to make it all well and good again. 
* OpenAI Whisper 
    * Had to install `python3-pip`, no big deal there. 
    * Running `pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git` is going to take 4+ minutes so I'lll go back to the handbook and open beer #3.

# Beer #3 
More to do with OpenAI Whisper
* Installing it did not update the `PATH` so I had to **GOOGLE** how to add that in again because I had already forgotten how I had solved this problem previously. So to solve this, I had to edit the `.bashrc` file with `nano ~/.bashrc` and add the path that the error was talking about to the end of the file `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` and then refresh using `source ~/.bashrc` to bring everything up to date again. After this, I was able to run `whisper --help` without issue.
* Back to the audio handbook
    * I think I found another disconnect in language

* Finished the chapter! There was a concerning note about how a software called `Patchage` has been discontinued in favor of `Carla` so I hope that future chapters show images from `Carla` 

# Beer #3 at 70% Consumed
* Oh god, going back in the web page and looking at the TOC, there seems to be some disconnect between the naming schemes and what was actually presented in terms of information. For example, in Chapter two there is a subsection named ` Configuring and testing your soundcard` and I did indeed configure, but there was no direction on how to **test** that configuration. Also, my fears about `Carla` are growing stronger. . . that software isn't mentioned until **Chapter 5** when I look at the TOC.
* The directions and screen shots seem to be for an older version before the transition to KDE. They are not organized in ways that the documentation describes.For example, the documentaiton image shows that the user should go to `Audio Production --> Sound Generators --> Hexter` but in the current KDE menu it removes the intermediate level of sorting with `Sound Generators`.

* BREAK DOWN- everything looks different . . . too intoxicated and confused to continue. Calling it quits.
