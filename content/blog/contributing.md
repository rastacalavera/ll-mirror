### Contributing Links
The easiest way to contribute to the project would be to submit links to the resource page. As submissions come in, they can be organized a bit more but for now, anything goes.

I have come to really like VSCode, so that is my preferred way to interact with Git and what this guide covers.

This guide assumes the following:
1. Reader has an account on [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
2. Reader has VScode [installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Reader understands some [Git Basics](https://discourse.destinationlinux.network/t/following-along-with-dln-git-spotlight/3072)

### Fork the Project
After you are logged into gitlab, the project needs to be **forked**.

Once forked, you can **clone** the project locally to you machine.
