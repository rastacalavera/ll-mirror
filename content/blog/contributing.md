### Contributing Links
The easiest way to contribute to the project would be to submit links to the resource page. As submissions come in, they can be organized a bit more but for now, anything goes.

I have come to really like VSCode, so that is my preferred way to interact with Git and what this guide covers.

This guide assumes the following:
1. Reader has an account on [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
2. Reader has VScode [installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Reader understands some [Git Basics](https://discourse.destinationlinux.network/t/following-along-with-dln-git-spotlight/3072)

### Fork the Project
After you are logged into gitlab, the project needs to be **forked**.
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://linuxlemming.com/img/episode/E01/fork.png" height="200" width="400" />

Once forked, you can **clone** the project locally to you machine.

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://linuxlemming.com/img/episode/E01/vsclone.png" height="100" width="800" />

Make changes to the project, like for example the `Resource.md` file:
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://linuxlemming.com/img/episode/E01/resources.png" height="300" width="800" />

Then **commit** and **push** those changes to your repository.
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://linuxlemming.com/img/episode/E01/push.png" height="300" width="800" />

### Open a Merge Request
Back in the browser at gitlab, you will need to go to the original project page to submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/rastacalavera/linuxlemming/-/merge_requests) and click on the `New Merge` request button.
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://linuxlemming.com/img/episode/E01/merge.png" height="100" width="800" />

The next steps walk you through on selecting the source and designation and gives you the opportunity to write any comments you wish to include.

### Wait for Approval
After you've submitted your request, I'll be notified. I can compare the changes and chose to accept or deny certain parts.

### Congratulations on a Successful Merge!
Most likely, your changes will be approved and you'll be a contributor!! Hooray!
