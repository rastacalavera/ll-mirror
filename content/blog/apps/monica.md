I've heard about Monica CRM for years but never really gave it a go. It sounds interesting to me to have a little storage of information about friends and family that isn't just a calendar with repeating birthday events or a random note on my phone.

Can't access the instance from IP:port. Documentatioin says to use localhost:8080 which I can't do.
