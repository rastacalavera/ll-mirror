### Special Thanks 
[Matt Stratton](https://github.com/mattstratton) for his hard work on the castanet theme which drives this site and to [rwaltr](https://discourse.destinationlinux.network/t/how-to-make-a-website-with-hugo-and-gitlab/2119) for his awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q6ZiCroiGM) on using Gitlab to create a website using Hugo. Also, the [DLN Crew](https://destinationlinux.org/) for their weekly spotlight on Git which motivated me.

### Original Documentation
Written documentation for getting started with building a simple blog lives [here](https://rastacalavera.gitlab.io/DLNhugo/post/git-and-hugo-walkthrough/)

### How to Contribute to the Linux Lemming

A detailed blog post will be made for this but in this episode I go over how to:
* setup git as a new user
* FORK the linuxlemming repo (difference between clone and fork) [^1]
* make changes in VSCode
* submit a Merge Request


### VSCode Documentation
I never looked at any [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support) for VSCode until I started the process for this episode. It seems that the documentation is very well done and approachable. I really like its level of organization and the inclusion of hyperlinks to other relevant material. 

I **REALLY** like the disclaimer of prior knowledge required to make good use of the documentation and how to gain the required knowledge if you don't meet that criteria.<br>
![vscode prior knowledge disclaimer with links](/img/episode/E01/vscode_intro.png)


I am still getting used to VSCode and will most likely do a blog post on it in the future but my first impression is that VSCode documentation gets a 10/10.
