Description = "This week I played with the LIT tag and got a little burnt. Just have to clean off the scissor cuts and try again. Ponder the importance of a GUID, and discuss progress with Audacity Label to chapter json for podcast 2.0 specs. I left in some out takes at the end from when I was trying to go live as well if you want a laugh. "
