00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to the Linux Lemming.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,860
So this is Episode 00, not really going in line with the view of what this whole project

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,480
will be, but I need to get something out there to start, and I'm learning along the way.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,360
So this is Episode 00, I'm Rasta Calavera, I'm a long-time desktop Linux user, and I'm

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,920
fairly new to the server realm.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I have a very small self-hosted setup, I don't think it's correct to call it a home

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,360
lab because it's really just a bunch of raspberry pies running Docker containers and things

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,600
like that, so my experimentation is pretty basic.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,520
I would describe myself as a hobbyist who knows enough to start projects, but doesn't

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,960
have enough free time to maintain them or spend hours troubleshooting them.

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,640
Now don't get me wrong, if something happens, I'm going to try my best, but I just don't

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
have a time investment that others may have.

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,040
So this gets me to the idea of a lemming.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,480
So I consider myself a lemming, and when I use that word, I'm defining it as someone

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,120
who appreciates, like, concise, up-to-date documentation and really just wants to see

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,200
more of it widely available.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,720
And we'll get into that in Episode 1 a bit more.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm also an Advid podcast listener, I consume a lot of podcasts from all across the spectrum,

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,440
some of the technology ones, I really enjoy everything that comes out of Jupiter Broadcasting,

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:59,960
Destination Linux, Joe Resington over in the UK there, and doing Late Night Linux, and

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
also the Ubuntu podcast over in the UK.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,760
Those are all great, great ones, and if you haven't heard of them, I highly, highly suggest

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,320
that you look them up.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,200
So what's this project going to be like?

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,560
Well, I think this is going to be mainly a place for people to listen or read my journey

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,360
as I kind of go through this, and they can do that either by listening to the podcast

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,840
or reading along with blogs.

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,640
I'm going to pick projects and just blindly follow the documentation, and I'm going to

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,400
report back on any successes and roadblocks that are along the way.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,280
You know, as things happen, I will try to submit upstream changes to projects for their

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,360
documentation if such a thing is available on GitHub or GitLab, and also I will submit

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,520
tutorials if it's appropriate to the project or just in general.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,280
And that gets me to this next point.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,320
This whole thing, this is not a dedicated information hub for how-to's.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,680
You know, so many already exist that I would rather contribute back to those than reinvent

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
the wheel.

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,320
So I would consider this mainly like a staging area for documentation that will be pushed

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,680
out to those bigger areas.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
And just a little example of that, based on the podcast I listen to, things like front

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,440
page Linux from Destination Linux or wiki.linuxdelta.com, which is run by Noah Chalaya.

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,080
And also on the JB side, there is a self-hosted.wiki that needs a lot of love.

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,200
So I feel like, you know, I would try to hit all of them if it's really relevant.

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
So can you contribute to this?

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes, please, please, please, please contribute to this.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,020
I kind of think of this as an open podcast.

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:03,640
So I listen to a lot of podcasts, but I can't really participate in the active ongoing discussion.

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,560
I would kind of classify myself as more of a lurker in the community.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm just really busy with my home life and work life that I consume everything at my

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
convenience.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,800
So I can't hop in mumble, I can't do jitsies or matrix or anything like that.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,040
I just listen to the podcast feed.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,920
And you know, I've really always wanted to get into podcasting and there was really

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,100
no easy barrier to entry.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,360
So if there's other listeners out there who want to try podcasting, I want to make this

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,720
a place where they can cut their teeth and you know, we'll take submissions and put them

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
in.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,480
So if you want to try your hand at podcasting, I really recommend you do it here.

58
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,960
If you want to submit your experience with projects, any documentation that you've already

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,840
made, again, we can get the wheels moving here and then push it to those other locations.

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,080
And for those contributions, I want to try to keep everything within GitLab.

61
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,300
That's where this repository is going to live and that will allow process tracking and things

62
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
like that.

63
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,200
So that's going to be my primary goal for contributions is to try to keep it within GitLab.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,480
So is there a schedule for this?

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
No, not really.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,520
I can only record audio at night or on days when I'm alone because I have a really loud

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,040
ambient noise in my living space.

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,520
So I am pretty limited on when I can actually do things.

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm really going to try for one new edition per week or maybe a bi-weekly schedule if

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
time allows.

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,960
And if community involvement picks up, well, then we'll release more frequently.

72
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,720
So it's kind of, you know, at our discretion currently not on iTunes or Pocketcast or Spotify

73
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,280
or Stitcher or anything like that.

74
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't really plan on pushing to those locations unless I have time or the community involvement

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,360
really kind of takes off or picks up because right now I'm just one guy sitting in a basement

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
talking into the void.

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,160
So I don't really see the point to push it out to those locations.

78
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,280
So again, like I said, I don't really consider this an official submission based on the ideals

79
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
of the project.

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,160
This is more of an obligatory episode.

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,440
That's why I'm using the Episode 00 tag for all of this.

82
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,560
I haven't quite settled on a topic yet for Episode 1.

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm thinking maybe it'll be about how to use get since I've already created a lot of documentation

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,480
for that on the destination Linux side.

85
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,560
And since that's how I want contributions to come in, probably would make sense to cover

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
that first.

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,920
So this will bring us to the end of Episode 00.

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:51,920
And if you're here in this and you want to contribute, then please head on over to thelinuxlemming.com.
