00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello, and welcome to The Linux Lemming.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm your host, Rostek Halibara.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,280
This is Episode 4, and I've decided to title this one Helping the Hippo.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:37,360
So this is Ubuntu 20.04 testing week, which has been crossing the feeds and all the Linux

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,880
podcasts out there and news areas and different things like that, so I figured this would

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:50,160
be a great opportunity to put the documentation to the test and also to help out a project.

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,320
So this is a great opportunity, and I've never participated in an event like this before,

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
so I'm really grateful that something like this exists.

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,920
Alan Pope recently made a forum post about the event that also includes documentation

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,200
for new testers and several different videos that you can watch to actually see him conduct

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,120
a test in real time.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,240
It's about an hour investment or so to read through the documentation and watch a video

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,560
in its entirety.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,320
The video that I watched was about 25 to 30 minutes long, and I did skip through a little

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,520
bit of it, but it is helpful to have that written documentation and a visual representation

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,760
as well.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,160
So after reading through and watching the videos, you have to log in to an Ubuntu account, which

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,840
I've had since 2008 or something like that, so I was able to log in to my account and

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,080
I got started.

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,880
When you do get started with the testing week, you have a lot of different options, and depending

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,960
on the test, some of them want you to do bare metal installs and different things like that.

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,720
I don't have any spare hardware at the moment, so I decided that I would try to do all of

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,400
my testing in VirtualBox.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:17,840
And I really haven't used VirtualBox all that much, but the process was pretty straightforward.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,680
So I downloaded the ISOs that I wanted to test.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I chose to do Kabuntu because that's what I run on a daily basis, and also Kylan.

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,200
I've never really used Kylan at all before, but looking at both of those flavors, I noticed

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
they still had tests that needed to be done in the live environment.

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,240
So I figured that would be a good thing to do.

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,320
So after installing VirtualBox, you have to click on to create a new virtual environment.

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,640
And when you go to set that up, you want to make sure that you change your settings to

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Linux and an Ubuntu flavor.

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
So I'm doing 64-bit.

34
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,520
I don't even know if these ones support 32, but there you have it.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,760
I think the default when you go into VirtualBox is to use a Windows system.

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,880
So just make sure you modify that as needed.

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,880
The next step is allocating memory for that VirtualBox.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,960
I have 32 gigabytes of memory on this laptop, so I gave it 8 gigabytes of memory.

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,400
So I didn't want to experience any issues.

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,840
I didn't have to provide any disk space.

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,600
So after you do the memory, it's going to ask if you want to create a virtual hard disk.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,680
And I figured since I'm not going to be living in this thing, I'm just testing the live environment

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,240
I don't need a virtual hard disk at all.

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,960
And that is an option.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,560
And after you click that, it's going to ask you, are you sure?

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
You'll only be able to run a live environment, and that's exactly what I want to do.

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
So no problems there.

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,720
So after you go through that, your VirtualBox will be created, but you still have to add

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,880
the ISO and tell it to boot from that.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,800
So you've got to click on the settings for the virtual environment that you just created.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Then you have to go to the controller IDE and tell it that you want it to be an optical

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,560
drive.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,680
And then after that, you add the ISO from wherever it lives on your computer.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,680
And in mine, it was just in my downloads folder.

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,520
After you've mounted that ISO, you need to click on that ISO image.

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,960
And then right below the optical drive, there's an option to tell it that this is a live CD

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
or DVD.

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,280
You want to make sure you click that because if you don't, it won't boot properly.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,400
So after that's all been set up, it's time to start up that virtual environment and

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,560
then work through the checklist that they have in their ISO tracker and submit any bugs.

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,160
So I started with Kabuntu.

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,080
And as soon as I booted that up, reading through their checklist, they said that the language

63
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,240
menu should be in the left column.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,800
And when I did it, it was above where it says install or try the live environment.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,200
So that was kind of the first discrepancy that I came across.

66
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,480
And that seemed to be the only one I came across in Kabuntu.

67
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
It functioned appropriately.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
All the apps worked just fine.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
There was no screen tearing.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It was great.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,160
It was like I was using it on bare metal.

72
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,800
So I just submitted that one small little thing that I saw and maybe it's a big deal.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,160
Maybe it's not, but it's on record there now.

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,880
So after going with Kabuntu, I booted up Kylan.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,120
And there were a lot of issues with that one.

76
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,480
One thing that stood out to me is when I booted up Kabuntu, there was no startup noise or

77
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
anything like that.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,640
But there was with Kylan.

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,560
So maybe I need to go back and check sound in Kabuntu.

80
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,480
But Kylan had a little startup ding and everything.

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,200
But as I was moving my cursor around, it was tearing on the screen.

82
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,400
And every time I opened an app and clicked, these white boxes would pop up and kind of

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,280
obscure the view and everything.

84
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,600
So it seemed like Kylan was not as polished in a virtual environment as Kabuntu was.

85
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,040
So I submitted two bugs for Kylan and we'll see where that takes it.

86
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm not quite sure.

87
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,840
I maybe skipped over that part in the video about what happens after you submit a bug.

88
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,920
But I imagine it needs to be reviewed or verified by other users before they treat it as an

89
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,600
actual issue.

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,320
So I'll just keep my eyes on that ISO tracker and see if anything changes or updates.

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,920
And hopefully I'll find some more time to do some more testing in a live environment.

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,200
Looking at like Ubuntu proper and things like that, it seemed like a lot of the tests had

93
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,160
already been done.

94
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,120
But I'll just keep looking down that list and see if there are other ways that I can

95
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
contribute.

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
So that's all I have for testing week.

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,480
Just a little update on the open web analytics.

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,640
I still haven't gotten that to play nicely with the swag container.

99
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:31,160
I found an ARM64 image for Shinet that somebody had made on their own and I think it was like

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,680
a year or two old.

101
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,600
So that might be part of the problem as well.

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,440
I've been really slow at getting back to the main developer and updating him on my process

103
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,000
and I feel pretty bad about that.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,520
So I just got to find time to execute on that conversation that we were having.

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,240
But that's all we have for the Linux Lemming this week.

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:23,080
I'll see you next time.
